## About

This portfolio was created using React. Just as a way to start testing some of the basic skills on how to use React.
The porfolio is all done using only front-end with no backend functional at the moment, so the contact section is currently no working to the fullest potential. So for now it's currently poitless to add any contact information and a message since it's going nowhere.

This is done in a single page, witht eh nav bar just rendering different parts of the components depending on what was selected.

As of right now, the LinkedIn and Stack Overflow links on the footer just lead to their respective mainpages, since I dont have accounts created just yet
